Urban Energy Balance - SUEWS Introduction
=========================================

Introduction
------------

In this tutorial you will use a land-surface model,
`SUEWS <http://suews-docs.readthedocs.io>`__ to simulate energy
exchanges in a city (London is the test case).

SUEWS (Surface Urban Energy and Water Balance Scheme) allows the energy
and water balance exchanges for urban areas to be modelled (Järvi et al.
`2011 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169411006937>`__, `2014 <http://www.geosci-model-dev.net/7/1691/2014/>`__, Ward et al.  `2016a <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095516300256>`__). The model is applicable at the
neighbourhood scale (e.g. 10\ :sup:`2` to 10\ :sup:`4` m). The fluxes
calculated are applicable to height of about 2-3 times the mean height
of the roughness elements; i.e. above the `roughness sublayer
(RSL) <http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Roughness_sublayer>`__. The use
of SUEWS within Urban Multi-scale Environmental Predictor (`UMEP <http://umep-docs.readthedocs.io>`__)
provides an introduction to the model and the processes simulated, the
parameters used and the impact on the resulting fluxes. Tools such as this, once appropriately assessed for an area, can be used
for a broad range of applications. For example, for climate services
(e.g. http://www.wmo.int/gfcs/). 

SUEWS can be run in a number of different ways:

#. Within UMEP via the `Simple <https://umep-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processor/Urban%20Energy%20Balance%20Urban%20Energy%20Balance%20(SUEWS,%20simple).html>`__ selection. This is useful for becoming
   familiar with the model.
#. Within UMEP via the `Advanced <https://umep-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/processor/Urban%20Energy%20Balance%20Urban%20Energy%20Balance%20(SUEWS.BLUEWS,%20advanced).html>`__ selection. This can be used to exploit
   the full capabilities of the model.
#. Via the `UMEP for Processing <https://umep-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/UMEPforProcessing.html>`__-plugin.
#. SUEWS standalone (see
   `manual <http://suews-docs.readthedocs.io>`__).
#. `SuPy <https://supy.readthedocs.io/>`__, a Python-enhanced tool for SUEWS.   
#. Within other larger scale models (e.g. `WRF <https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/weather-research-and-forecasting-model>`__).

Tutorial Objectives
-------------------

This tutorial introduces SUEWS and demonstrates how to run the model within UMEP. 

Steps
~~~~~

#. An introduction to the model and how it is designed (above).
#. Different kinds of input data that are needed to run the model
#. How to run the model
#. How to examine the model output

Initial Steps
-------------

UMEP is a python plugin used in conjunction with
`QGIS <http://www.qgis.org>`__. To install the software and the UMEP
plugin see the `getting started <http://umep-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Getting_Started.html>`__ section in the UMEP manual.

As UMEP is under development, some documentation may be missing and/or
there may be instability. Please report any issues or suggestions to our
`repository <https://github.com/UMEP-dev/UMEP>`__.

SUEWS Model Inputs
------------------

Details of the model inputs and outputs are provided in the `SUEWS
manual <http://suews-docs.readthedocs.io>`__. As this tutorial is
concerned with a **simple application** only the most critical
parameters are shown. Other versions allow many other parameters to be
modified to more appropriate values if applicable. The table below
provides an overview of the parameters that can be modified in the
Simple application of SUEWS.

How to Run SuewsSimple from the UMEP-plugin
-------------------------------------------

#. Open SuewsSimple from *UMEP -> Processor -> Urban Energy Balance ->
   Urban Energy Balance, SUEWS (Simple)*. The `GUI <https://umep-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Abbreviations.html>`__ that opens looks quite
   extensive but it is actually not that complicated to start a basic
   model run (figure below). Some additional information about the plugin is
   found in the left window. As you can read, a **test dataset** from
   observations for London, UK (`Kotthaus and Grimmond
   2014 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095513000503>`__,
   `Ward et al.
   2016a <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095516300256>`__)
   is included within the plugin.

    :alt:  none
    :width: 100%

    The interface for SUEWS, simple version (click on image to make it larger).
   
#. To make use of this dataset click on **Add settings from test
   dataset** (see near bottom of the box). The land cover fractions and
   all other settings originate from Kotthaus and Grimmond (2014). They
   used a source area model to obtain the different input parameters
   (their `Fig. 7 in Kotthaus and Grimmond,
   2014 <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212095513000497>`__).
#. Before you start the model, change the location of the output data to
   any location of your choice. Also, make notes on the settings such as
   *Soil moisture state* etc.
#. Do a model run and explore the results by clicking **Run**. Once the calculations are done, some of
   the results are shown in two summary plots (if **Show basic plots of model reults** is ticked in).

.. figure:: /images/SUEWSIntro_SuewsSimplefig1.jpg

The graphs in the upper figure are the monthly mean energy (left) and water
balance (right). The lower graphs show the radiation fluxes,
energy fluxes, and water related outputs throughout the year. This plot
includes a lot of data and it might be difficult to examine it in
detail.

To zoom into the plot: use the tools in the top left corner, to zoom to
a period of interest. For example, the Zoom in to about the last ten
days in March (figure below).

.. figure:: /images/SUEWSIntro_SuewsSimplefig2zoom.jpg
    :alt:  none
    :width: 100%
    
    Zoom in on end of March from the daily plot (click on image to make it larger). 


To save a figure, simply use the disk tool in the upper left corner of the figure window. 

Output data Files
-----------------

In the output folder (you selected earlier) you will find (at least)
two files:

#. **Kc1_2011_60.txt** – provides the 60 min model results for the year 2011. **Kc** is the gridcode specified earlier and **1** is the grid number (only one grid in this case). 
#. **Kc1_DailyState.txt** – this provides the daily mean state (see
   SUEWS manual for detailed explanation). This allows you to see, for
   example, the daily state of the LAI (leaf area index).
#. **RunControl.nml** - includes overall settings used in the model run. 

If you open these files in a text editor. To understand the header
variables read the `SUEWS manual <http://suews-docs.readthedocs.io>`__.

Sensitivity to land surface fractions
-------------------------------------

The previous results are for a densely build-up area in
London, UK. In order to test the sensitivity of SUEWS to some surface
properties you can think about changing some of the surface properties
in the SUEWS Simple. For example, change the land cover fraction by:

#. Change the land cover fractions by reducing paved by 20% (0.230) and increase
   grass surface by 20% (0.230). You can also change other values as long as all 
   the fractions *add up to 1.0*. If you change the building or tree fractions you also
   need to change the `PAI <https://umep-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Abbreviations.html>`__ fraction in the two top panels as they are connected to land cover fractions.
#. Save the output to a different folder by selecting *output folder*.
#. Click *Run*.
#. Examine the results and compare with the default run you made previously, e.g. for the ten last days in March 2011. To reproduce the daily basic plot you can exploit *UMEP > Post-Processor > Urban Energy Balance > SUEWS Analyzer*.

    - Open SUEWS Analyzer.
    - Load the **RunControl.nml** found in your output folder for a specific run.
    - In the left panel (**Plot data**), Specify grid no. 1 and Year to investigate 2011.
    - Tick in *Plot basic data* and click **Plot**.

This uses the height and spacing of roughness elements (e.g. buildings,
trees) to model the roughness parameters. For more details see `Kent et

The `Kormann and Meixner

model is used to determine the probable area that a turbulent flux
measurement was impacted by. This is a function of wind direction,
stability, turbulence characteristics (friction velocity, variance of
the lateral wind velocity) and roughness parameters.
